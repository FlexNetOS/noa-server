# Accessibility Statement

**Effective Date**: January 2025

## Our Commitment

Noa Server is committed to ensuring digital accessibility for all people,
including those with disabilities. We are continually improving the user
experience for everyone and applying the relevant accessibility standards.

## Conformance Status

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) define requirements for
designers and developers to improve accessibility for people with disabilities.
It defines three levels of conformance: Level A, Level AA, and Level AAA.

**The Noa Server UI Dashboard is fully conformant with WCAG 2.1 Level AA.**

"Fully conformant" means that the content fully conforms to the accessibility
standard without any exceptions.

- Ensured compatibility with assistive technologies

### Testing and Validation

- Regular automated testing with axe-core and Lighthouse
