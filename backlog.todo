2. Dependencies identified and resolved
3. Acceptance criteria documented
4. Owners assigned

### During Planning
1. Review sprint goal and priorities
2. Pull items from "Next Sprint" section
3. Ensure team capacity not exceeded
4. Break down large items if needed
5. Commit to sprint backlog

### Capacity Planning
```
Team Capacity = (Team Size × Hours per Week × Focus Factor)

Where:
